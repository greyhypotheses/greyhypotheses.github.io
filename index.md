<br>

The <a href="https://github.com/greyhypotheses" target="\_blank">repositories</a> of greyhypotheses are grouped by GitHub Organization.  The [Content](greyhypotheses/content.md) section outlines a few repositories by GitHub Organization; all repositories are outlined within <a href="https://github.com/greyhypotheses" target="\_blank">GitHub</a>.

**Note**: Almost all the projects I have been involved in are private organisation/institution projects, hence most projects can neither be detailed nor shared.
