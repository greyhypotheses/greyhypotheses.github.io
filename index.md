A brief introduction to the repositories of greyhypotheses
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/greyhypotheses" target="\_blank">repositories</a> of greyhypotheses are grouped into GitHub organisations.  The [Structure](/structure/structure.md) section outlines these organisations.  All repositories are outlined within <a href="https://github.com/greyhypotheses" target="\_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

**Note**: Almost all the projects I have been involved in are private organisation/institution projects, and hence can neither be detailed nor shared.
