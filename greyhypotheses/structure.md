[plausibilities](https://github.com/plausibilities) |Is focused on Bayesian modelling explorations via <a href="https://docs.pymc.io" target="\_blank">PyMC3</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/">TensorFlow Probability</a>.  Additional explorations are conducted via Google Colab; the projects therein will be continuously set-up within <a href="https://github.com/plausibilities" target="\_blank">plausibilities</a>.  Examples: <br> * [plausibilities/fundamentals](https://github.com/plausibilities/fundamentals){:target="\_blank"}<br/>Exploring PyMC3, and TensorFlow Probability, for Bayesian modelling & analysis; the TensorFlow Probability prototypes are currently Google Colab projects. <br> * [plausibilities/sars](https://github.com/plausibilities/sars){:target="\_blank"}<br/>Forecasting amidst uncertainty in relation to SARS-CoV-2.
